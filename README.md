# Deeplearning-with-Pytorch
This repository contains labs and projects from the IBM course called 'Deeplearning with Pytorch' on coursera platform. https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-deep-learning-with-pytorch 
It explains:
Key concepts on Softmax regression and understand its application in multi-class classification problems.
How to develop and train shallow neural networks with various architectures.
Key concepts of deep neural networks, including techniques like dropout, weight initialization, and batch normalization.
How to develop convolutional neural networks, apply layers and activation functions.
